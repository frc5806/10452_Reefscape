# The Code for 10452's REEFSCAPE Game

## Done about 1% by Sebastian Baxter, 3% by Ethan Rosenfled, 6% by Sophie Willer-Buchardi, and 90% by people we don't know

In person Tasks:
- Make sure limelight works
    - Also in Autonomous! 
- Output values for the motor speed encoder in the Coral subsystem to see if our current method of measuring speed works
- Test the new elevator autonomous methods in pathplanner

Spring Break Tasks:
- Build 3 rigorous autonomous paths
- Build LED Controllers
    - Will have to use Phoenix 5 because CANdles are not yet supported by Phenix 6 (this has been done by other teams). Should be fairly straightforward otherwise.
